[ ] Remove the various UI choices that now conflict with each other (eg. having both a new chat button and a warning on deletion but then the conversation history)
[ ] Ensure the UI is usable and looks good from a user's perspective, and fix any issue that might make junas less appealing to use
[ ] Fix any bugs arising from the current iteration of tree/conversation tree
[ ] See if there are any services that let the PROJECT ITSELF be deployed via the docker build instead of hard rebuilding on vercel
